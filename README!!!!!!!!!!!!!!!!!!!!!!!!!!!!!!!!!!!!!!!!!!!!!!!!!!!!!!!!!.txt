if you want to use this you need to have xampp
once running xampp import the two SQL database 
make sure you have "test" open inside PHPMyAdmin
either copy and paste or press import
then inside "htdocs" in xampp install path upload the files inside a folder then run that path on browser (http://localhost/Prototype/home.php)
then you have to register to use the website then login 
if an error occurs this means you havent setup the DB correctly
